# Examples

These examples demonstrate the main features of Vncserver and how to use them.
To run an example, use the command `cargo run --example <Example>`, e.g.

```sh
# Runs the "sample" example
cargo run --example sample
```

When you clone the repo locally to run the examples, use `git checkout` to get the correct version:

```bash
# use a specific version
git checkout <version>
```
